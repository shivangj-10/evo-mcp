## What is MCP?

> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.
>
> — [Model Context Protocol README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)

An MCP Server is a lightweight program that provides specific features through the Model Context Protocol standard. Applications like chatbots, code editors, and AI tools run MCP clients that each establish a direct connection with an MCP server. Popular MCP clients include agentic code assistants (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com)) and conversational tools like Claude Desktop, with more expected in the future. MCP servers can connect to both local and remote data, supplying enriched information that enables AI models to generate more accurate and useful results.

MCP servers are consumable by any MCP client such as VS Code, Claude Desktop, or a Google ADK agent.

## What is the Evo MCP server?

The Evo MCP server is a self-hosted server that provides a secure, standardised interface between your AI tools and the Evo platform. It acts as a bridge, exposing Evo SDK functionality - like access to your workspaces, geoscience objects, and block models - to any AI model or agent you choose.

The server comes packaged with many tools written by Seequent, but it is fully extensible and users are encouraged to add their own tools.

### How teams use Evo MCP

* Workspace management: Create workspaces, summarize objects, snapshot and duplicate workspaces, copy objects between workspaces.
* Geoscience object creation: structured geoscience objects (pointsets, line segments, downhole collections, and downhole intervals) in Evo directly from raw CSV files, automating data validation and schema mapping.

> [!WARNING]
> The Evo MCP server is in early development and functionality is limited. Your feedback on future development is welcome!

### Key components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **MCP clients** | Any MCP-compatible application connects to the server over `STDIO` or `streamable HTTP`. |
| **FastMCP server** | The core server runtime that handles MCP protocol, tool registration, and request routing. |
| **Tool modules** | Tools are grouped by category and conditionally registered based on the `MCP_TOOL_FILTER` setting. General tools are always loaded. |
| **EvoContext** | Manages OAuth authentication (with token caching), Evo SDK client initialization, and organization/hub selection. Initialization is lazy — it happens on the first tool call, triggering a browser-based login if needed. |
| **Evo APIs** | The Evo SDK packages (block model, geoscience object, workspace) communicate with Seequent Evo over HTTPS. |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Access to Seequent Evo (https://evo.seequent.com)

### Installation 

#### 1. Clone this repository
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-mcp.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the root directory
```powershell
cd <path-to-this-repository>
```

#### 3. Create a Python environment

<strong>Option 1: Using `uv` (recommended)</strong>

The Python package manager `uv` makes it easy to set up your Python environment. Visit the [uv website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to learn more.

##### a. Install `uv` (if not already installed)

##### Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

##### macOS and Linux

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

##### b. Create the Python environment including dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```

<strong>Option 2: Using `pip` and `pyenv`</strong>

If you prefer using `pip` and `pyenv` to manage your Python environment:

##### a. Install `pyenv` (if not already installed)
   - **Windows**: Use [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation)
   - **macOS**: `brew install pyenv`
   - **Linux**: Follow [pyenv installation guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)


##### b. Install Python 3.10+
   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.10
   pyenv local 3.10
   ```

##### c. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

##### d. Activate the virtual environment

##### Windows
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

##### macOS and Linux

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

##### e. Install dependencies

Install essential runtime dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install dev dependencies along with the essential runtime dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

#### 4. Choose an MCP transport mode (optional)

The Evo MCP server supports two common transport modes for different use cases.

##### STDIO transport (default)

**Recommended for**: VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other integrated MCP clients

`STDIO` (Standard Input/Output) is the default transport mode and is optimised for direct integration with MCP client applications. This transport communicates through standard input and output streams, making it perfect for command-line tools and desktop applications like VS Code and Cursor.
With STDIO transport, the client spawns a new server process for each session and manages its lifecycle. The server reads MCP messages from stdin and writes responses to stdout. This is why STDIO servers don’t stay running - they’re started on-demand by the client.

**Advantages**
- Simpler configuration - client handles connection automatically
- Better performance for local connections
- Directly integrated into VS Code and Cursor workflows
- No network overhead

Configure your client (VS Code, Cursor, etc.) to start the MCP server process. The client will handle all communication via STDIO.

##### Streamable HTTP transport

**Recommended for**: Testing, remote access, programmatic access via curl/scripts, and containerised deployments (Docker)

HTTP transport turns your MCP server into a web service accessible via a URL. This transport uses the Streamable HTTP protocol, which allows clients to connect over the network. Unlike STDIO where each client gets its own process, an HTTP server can handle multiple clients simultaneously.

The Streamable HTTP protocol provides full bidirectional communication between client and server, supporting all MCP operations including streaming responses. This makes it the recommended choice for network-based deployments.

**Advantages**
- Can be accessed via curl, programming languages, or HTTP clients
- Useful for testing and debugging
- Enables remote access to the server
- Simplifies integration with custom tools and scripts
- Ideal for containerised deployments (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Works well in cloud environments and microservices architectures

**Limitations**
- Requires separate server process management
- Slightly higher latency due to HTTP overhead

##### Common use cases

| Use case | Recommended mode |
|----------|-----------------|
| Using VS Code with Copilot | STDIO |
| Using Cursor with AI | STDIO |
| Using Claude Desktop | STDIO |
| Testing tools with curl | Streamable HTTP |
| Remote server access | Streamable HTTP |
| Custom script integration | Streamable HTTP |


#### 5. Configure your environment

##### Evo app credentials

You first need to create a **native app** in the [iTwin Developer Portal](https://developer.bentley.com/register/?product=seequent-evo). This app will allow you to sign in with your Bentley account in access Seequent Evo. Visit the [Evo Developer Portal](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/apps-and-tokens) to learn more.

Make a copy of the file `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Fill in your app credentials:
```bash
EVO_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
EVO_REDIRECT_URL=your-redirect-url
```

##### MCP transport mode (optional)

The Evo MCP server supports two transport modes: **STDIO** and **streamable HTTP**. By default, the server runs in **STDIO** mode which is recommended for local development.

Set `MCP_TRANSPORT` environment variable in `.env` to choose the transport mode:
- `STDIO` - Standard input/output (default)
- `HTTP` - Streamable HTTP

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=STDIO
```

If using HTTP mode, also configure the host and port:
```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=HTTP
MCP_HTTP_HOST=localhost
MCP_HTTP_PORT=5000
```

When using HTTP mode, the MCP server must be running and reachable at the configured URL. The setup scripts can start it automatically for you, or you can run it manually.

##### MCP tool filtering (optional)

Set `MCP_TOOL_FILTER` environment variable in `.env` to filter available tools:
- `admin` - Workspace/instance management and bulk data operations
- `data` - Object import, download and query operations  
- `all` - All tools (default)

```bash
MCP_TOOL_FILTER=all
```

## Connect to Evo MCP

Apps like VS Code and Cursor make it easy to connect to MCP servers, whether they are running locally, are available over a local network, or over the internet. VS Code is free to download and use. Cursor requires a paid subscription.

NOTE: Installing any of the MCP client apps described in this section is entirely optional. If you have a favourite MCP client app that you think we should document here, please create a [feature request ticket](https://github.com/SeequentEvo/evo-mcp/issues) and let us know.

### VS Code

#### Installation

VS Code comes in two versions - **VS Code** and **VS Code Insiders**. Install one of these apps before running Evo MCP. 
NOTE: Both of these apps can be installed and used independently.

- Install the regular version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (recommended).
- Install [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) for the most up-to-date experience. VS Code Insiders provides early access to the latest features and improvements for MCP integration. 

#### Configuration

Run the supplied Python script to add the required settings. The script will ask you a series of questions in the console.

**If you set up Python with `uv`:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/setup_mcp.py
```

**If you set up Python with `pip`:**
```bash
python scripts/setup_mcp.py
```

**Manual method**
1. Copy the settings found in `templates/vscode-stdio-config.json`.
  - For HTTP mode, use `templates/vscode-http-config.json` instead.
  - Update the template URL host and port to match `MCP_HTTP_HOST` and `MCP_HTTP_PORT` in your `.env`, and ensure the HTTP server is running.
2. Open the **Command Palette** (press `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS / `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
3. Search for "mcp". Select **MCP: Open User Configuration** to update the user settings.
  ![VS Code Command Palette](images/vscode-command-palette.png)
4. Paste the settings you copied from the template, update the paths to match your local installation, and save the file. NOTE: The JSON template shows Windows file paths but the screenshot below shows macOS file paths. Follow the conventions that suit your operating system. 
  ![VS Code MCP Settings](images/vscode-settings.png)
5. The MCP server will start automatically when accessed by Copilot.

#### Verify the configuration

2. Look for **evo-mcp** in the list of **MCP Servers - Installed**.

    ![VS Code MCP Servers](images/vscode-mcp-servers.png)

3. Ensure there are no warning icons or error messages displayed.

If you see **evo-mcp** listed without any warnings, the configuration is correct and the server is ready to use.

### Cursor

#### Installation

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor with built-in support for MCP servers. To use the Evo MCP server in Cursor first [download and install it](https://cursor.com/download). 
NOTE: Cursor requires a paid subscription to use MCP features.

#### Configuration

Run the supplied Python script to add the required settings. The script will ask you a series of questions in the console.

**If you set up Python with `uv`:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/setup_mcp.py
```

**If you set up Python with `pip`:**
```bash
python scripts/setup_mcp.py
```

#### Manual method
1. Copy the settings found in `templates/cursor-stdio-config.json`.
  - For HTTP mode, use `templates/cursor-http-config.json` instead.
  - Update the template URL host and port to match `MCP_HTTP_HOST` and `MCP_HTTP_PORT` in your `.env`, and ensure the HTTP server is running.
2. Open the **Command Palette** (press `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS / `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
3. Search for "mcp". Select either **View: Open MCP Settings** to update the user settings.

5. Paste the settings you copied from the template, update the paths to match your local installation, and save the file. NOTE: The JSON template shows Windows file paths but the screenshot below shows macOS file paths. Follow the conventions that suit your operating system. 
  ![Cursor MCP Settings](images/cursor-settings.png)
6. The MCP server will start automatically when accessed by Cursor AI.

#### Verifying the integration

To verify that the Evo MCP server is correctly configured in Cursor:

1. Open **Settings > Cursor Settings**.
2. In the search bar, type **Tools & MCP**.
3. Look for **evo-mcp** in the **Installed MCP Servers** list. The MCP server should be enabled, display with a green light and list the properties of the server, eg. number of tools, etc.
  ![Cursor Verify Settings](images/cursor-verify-settings.png)


### Additional tips

- **Use a separate workspace**: Create a new workspace that is separate to your clone of this repository. If your copilot/agent has access to the source files in this repository, it may decide to ignore the MCP server.
- **STDIO mode starts on demand**: In `STDIO` mode, VS Code/Cursor will launch the MCP server when needed.
- **HTTP mode needs a running server**: If you select `HTTP`, the server must already be running. The setup script can start it for you in the current terminal session so you can see live output.
- **Check your environment variables**: Ensure `EVO_CLIENT_ID` and `EVO_REDIRECT_URL` are set in your `.env` file before connecting.
- **Reload after changes**: If you edit settings or `.env` values, reload the window so the client picks up the new config.

## Advanced

### Testing with curl

Running Evo MCP in streamable HTTP mode allows you to use `curl` to access the MCP tools.

**Setup:**
```bash
# In .env or environment
MCP_TRANSPORT=HTTP
MCP_HTTP_HOST=localhost
MCP_HTTP_PORT=5000
```

**Start the server:**

If you ran `setup_mcp.py`, selected `HTTP`, and chose to start now, the script starts the server in the current terminal so you can see live logs.

Otherwise, start it manually:
```bash
python src/mcp_tools.py
```

The server will start listening on `http://localhost:5000/mcp`.

**Access tools using curl:**

**macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)**
```bash
# 1) Initialize session and capture MCP session ID
SESSION_ID=$(curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null \
  -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"1.0"}}}' \
  | awk 'BEGIN{IGNORECASE=1}/^mcp-session-id:/{print $2}' | tr -d '\r')

# 2) List workspaces
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: ${SESSION_ID}" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_workspaces","arguments":{"name":"","deleted":false,"limit":50}}}'

# 3) Create a workspace
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: ${SESSION_ID}" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"create_workspace","arguments":{"name":"My New Workspace","description":"Test workspace"}}}'
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
# 1) Initialize session and capture MCP session ID
$initHeaders = curl.exe -sS -D - -o NUL `
  -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" `
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"curl","version":"1.0"}}}'

$SESSION_ID = ($initHeaders | Select-String -Pattern '^mcp-session-id:\s*(.+)$' -CaseSensitive:$false).Matches[0].Groups[1].Value.Trim()

# 2) List workspaces
curl.exe -sS -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" `
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SESSION_ID" `
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_workspaces","arguments":{"name":"","deleted":false,"limit":50}}}'

# 3) Create a workspace
curl.exe -sS -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" `
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SESSION_ID" `
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"create_workspace","arguments":{"name":"My New Workspace","description":"Test workspace"}}}'
```

> Note: Streamable HTTP requires clients to send `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`.

### Testing with a Google ADK agent

An example Google ADK agent is provided for testing the MCP server:

**Prerequisites**
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` CLI) installed and configured

  ```powershell
  gcloud auth application-default login
  ```

- A GCP project with Vertex AI API enabled

**Add to `.env`**

```bash
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=your-region

# Passed through to the MCP server's `MCP_TOOL_FILTER` config.
MCP_TOOL_FILTER=all
```

**Run**
  ```powershell
  cd src\agents
  adk web
  ```

Browse to http://localhost:8000 to interact with the agent.

## Development

To add new MCP tools:
1. Add tool function to appropriate module in `src/evo_mcp/tools/`
2. Decorate with `@mcp.tool()` decorator
3. Tools are auto-registered based on their module (general/admin/data) on server startup
4. Test using VS Code integration or the ADK agent
